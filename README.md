# UpStyle-Irradiance

The Arduino IDE extension provided by espressif seems to work at first pass (thanks jost27):
https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32
it also seems like espressif has implemented rudimentary BT support in the arduino port

I also tested out the micropython port to the esp32, in particular the branch with BT support:
https://github.com/MrSurly/micropython-esp32/tree/dev-bluetooth/esp32
and I was able to connect to it with my phone.
